Basic of Networking
Network means a group of two or more devices that are connected for a purpose which can be sharing and communication etc. 
There are major three kinds of Network:
WAN: Wide Area Network which are deployed on vast geogrophical area for example all over the world. Internet is WAN
LAN: Local Area Network which are deployed on small location like a building or room where devices are interconnected with wire or wirelessly 
MAN: Metropolitan Area Network which is Bigger than Local Area but smaller than Wide Area for example connecting two campuses, offices etc
Internet that is in working is consists of ISP full form Internet Service Provider for example PTCL or Other Telecom Companies then a broadband or router then further
devices are connected to this router through certain IPs. Some IPs are public and some are private. Ipv4 is running out of addresses due to limited 4.3 billion possible
addresses while ipv6 is get started working due to larger scalabality of 380 trillion trillion trillion addresses available. There are Model for communication over 
network, most well renownned is OSI (open System Interconnection ) which is consists of sevel layers. Which are as follow:
1. Application Layer
2. Presentation Layer
3. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer 
5. Network Layer 
6. Data link Layer
7. Physical Layer
The practical Implementaion of OSI is TCP/IP which has following layers
1. Application Layer (presentation and seesion layer included)
2. Transport Layer
3. Internet Layer
4. Network access layer
